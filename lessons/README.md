# Learning Fastapi 
Asynchronous code just means that the language 💬 has a way to tell the computer / program 🤖 that at some point in the code, it 🤖 will have to wait for something else to finish somewhere else. Let's say that something else is called "slow-file" 📝.

So, during that time, the computer can go and do some other work, while "slow-file" 📝 finishes.

## Concurrency
Then the computer / program 🤖 will come back every time it has a chance because it's waiting again, or whenever it 🤖 finishes all the work it had at that point. And it 🤖 will see if any of the tasks it was waiting for have already finished, doing whatever it had to do.

Next, it 🤖 takes the first task to finish (let's say, our "slow-file" 📝) and continues whatever it had to do with it.

That "wait for something else" normally refers to I/O operations that are relatively "slow" (compared to the speed of the processor and the RAM memory), like waiting for:

the data from the client to be sent through the network
the data sent by your program to be received by the client through the network
the contents of a file on the disk to be read by the system and given to your program
the contents your program gave to the system to be written to disk
a remote API operation
a database operation to finish
a database query to return the results
etc.
As the execution time is consumed mostly by waiting for I/O operations, they call them "I/O bound" operations.

It's called "asynchronous" because the computer / program doesn't have to be "synchronized" with the slow task, waiting for the exact moment that the task finishes, while doing nothing, to be able to take the task result and continue the work.

Instead of that, by being an "asynchronous" system, once finished, the task can wait in line a little bit (some microseconds) for the computer / program to finish whatever it went to do, and then come back to take the results and continue working with them.

For "synchronous" (contrary to "asynchronous") they commonly also use the term "sequential", because the computer / program follows all the steps in sequence before switching to a different task, even if those steps involve waiting.


EXAMPLE

Imagine you are the computer / program 🤖 in that story.

While you are at the line, you are just idle 😴, waiting for your turn, not doing anything very "productive". But the line is fast because the cashier is only taking the orders (not preparing them), so that's fine.

Then, when it's your turn, you do actual "productive" work, you process the menu, decide what you want, get your crush's choice, pay, check that you give the correct bill or card, check that you are charged correctly, check that the order has the correct items, etc.

But then, even though you still don't have your burgers, your work with the cashier is "on pause" ⏸, because you have to wait 🕙 for your burgers to be ready.

But as you go away from the counter and sit at the table with a number for your turn, you can switch 🔀 your attention to your crush, and "work" ⏯ 🤓 on that. Then you are again doing something very "productive" as is flirting with your crush 😍.

Then the cashier 💁 says "I'm finished with doing the burgers" by putting your number on the counter's display, but you don't jump like crazy immediately when the displayed number changes to your turn number. You know no one will steal your burgers because you have the number of your turn, and they have theirs.

So you wait for your crush to finish the story (finish the current work ⏯ / task being processed 🤓), smile gently and say that you are going for the burgers ⏸.

Then you go to the counter 🔀, to the initial task that is now finished ⏯, pick the burgers, say thanks and take them to the table. That finishes that step / task of interaction with the counter ⏹. That in turn, creates a new task, of "eating burgers" 🔀 ⏯, but the previous one of "getting burgers" is finished ⏹.



## Parllelism
Now let's imagine these aren't "Concurrent Burgers", but "Parallel Burgers".

You go with your crush to get parallel fast food.

You stand in line while several (let's say 8) cashiers that at the same time are cooks take the orders from the people in front of you.

Everyone before you is waiting for their burgers to be ready before leaving the counter because each of the 8 cashiers goes and prepares the burger right away before getting the next order.
